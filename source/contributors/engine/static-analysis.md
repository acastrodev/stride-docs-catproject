# Static Analysis

We would like to thank [NDepend](https://www.ndepend.com/) for allowing us to use their tool for static analysis of the Stride game engine at no cost, supporting our open-source project.

For detailed insights generated by NDepend for the Stride game engine, visit our [NDepend Report](https://stride3d.github.io/static-analysis/stride/ndepend/NDependReport.html#Main).

Note that some issues might be false positives, and the report has not yet been configured for game engine paradigms. Such false positives could be ignored or reconfigured to meet our specific needs.

Please explore the following sections of the report:

- [Overview](https://stride3d.github.io/static-analysis/stride/ndepend/NDependReport.html#Main) - A general summary of the analysis.
- [Projects](https://stride3d.github.io/static-analysis/stride/ndepend/NDependReport.html#projects-summary) - Lists all 63 projects along with related metrics.
- [Dependency Matrix](https://stride3d.github.io/static-analysis/stride/ndepend/NDependReportFiles/ComponentDependenciesMatrix.png) - A visual representation of dependencies between projects. The numbers in the matrix cells represent the count of types involved in the coupling.
- [Treemap Metric View](https://stride3d.github.io/static-analysis/stride/ndepend/NDependReportFiles/VisualNDependView.png) - Each rectangle represents a method, with the area of the rectangle proportional to the number of lines of code in that method.

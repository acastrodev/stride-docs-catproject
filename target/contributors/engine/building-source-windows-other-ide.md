# Build Stride without Visual Studio

1. Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe) with the same prerequisites listed [here](building-source-windows.md)
2. Add MSBuild's directory to your system's *PATH* (ex: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\MSBuild\Current\Bin`)
3. Open a command prompt, point it to a directory and clone Stride to it: `git lfs clone https://github.com/stride3d/stride.git`
4. Navigate to `/Build` with the command prompt, input `msbuild /t:Restore Stride.sln` then `compile.bat`

## Build Stride with Rider
With Rider 2024.1 and after [commit 0e053a3](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/commit/0e053a3b8873f49e9e0e5450a3dfad368a6ed042) Stride can now be built hassle free from Rider, you just have to make sure that `Use ReSharper Build` is enabled in your settings.

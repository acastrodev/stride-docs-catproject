Assuming you have made all necessary changes and tested them on the development server, you can submit a pull request to the `master` branch. The pull request will be reviewed and merged by the website maintainers.

Steps to contribute your updates:

1. Commit your changes to your forked repository:
   - Commit the changes with a meaningful message
   - Push the changes to your forked repository
1. Create a pull request to the main repository:
   - You can create a pull request from your forked repository by navigating to Pull requests page and click **New pull request** button
   - Select the **master** branch as the base branch and your branch as the compare branch
   - Click **Create pull request** button

Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository and deployed to the website.
